# Professional-Portfolio

## Description
This project is a beginner portfolio for web development and will be modified as new skills are learned. 

Focus of project:
  GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
* WHEN I load their portfolio
  THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
  THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
  THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
  THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* WHEN I click on the images of the applications
  THEN I am taken to that deployed application
* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
  THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
